Lead Genomics Data Scientist at Brown University's Computational Biology Core and the [Center for Computation and Visualization](https://ccv.brown.edu). Former community organizer, current workout and games hobbyist. You can most likely find me at CrossFit, surfing, playing mahjong, video games, or jiujitsu when I'm not at work.

My primary research interest is in quantifying uncertainty in genomics workflows. In a way, that is also my motivation and mantra in community organizing: becoming comfortable with uncertainty and always pushing for change.
